Welcome to DevSecOps Studio Project!
===================

DevSecOps Studio is a virtual environment to learn and teach DevSecOps concepts. Its easy to get started and is mostly automatic.

It takes lots of efforts to setup a DevSecOps environment for training/demos and more often, its error prone when done manually.

This project aims to reduce the time to bootstrap the environment

> **Note:**

## Summary of Setup
### TL;DR

Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html), [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_installation.html#installation) and Follow the below steps.

```bash
# Download the code
$ git clone https://github.com/teacheraio/DevSecOps-Studio.git && cd DevSecOps-Studio

# Download the ansible dependency roles
$ ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml -p provisioning/roles

# Setup the environment, takes an hour or less based on your internet speed.
$ vagrant up
```
Go grab some coffee while DevSecOps Studio does its job.

Yes, that's it, you just setup entire DevSecOps environment with three commands :)

### Details

DevSecOps Studio uses `vagrant`, `virtualbox` and `ansible` to setup the lab environment. You can visit the vendor's website to download the above software for on Windows/Linux/macOS.
